      "Jay was a great addition to our team at Amazon. He ramped up quickly and gelled with the team even though he was the sole member in a remote location. He made cool contributions in an ambiguous domain of our highly complex platform and we were all excited about his potential. I would hire him again given the opportunity!",

With this knowledge, Jay tackled a variety of projects: from frontend user interface features in React to a new unit testing framework for an internal serverless platform in Amazon. Paired with his always positive easy-going attitude, he was a delight to work with. I recommend Jay as a valuable asset to any software development organization.",
